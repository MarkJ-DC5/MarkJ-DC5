## Image CLassification
### Skin Cancer Classification
**Description:** <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Short Description of the Project <br>
**Challenge :**<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main challenge with the project is having a dataset that is greatly imabalanced causing the model to have a weak ability in differentiating each type of skin cancer. I balanaced the dataset resulting to 1,500 images per class by downsampling the classes containings images more than 1,500, and augmenting the images per class to increase the size and reach the target number of images of class which is 1,500. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another challenege is that visually, it is already hard to distingues between the different classes of skin cancer, thus a simple Neural Network does not work. Thus, I use the concept of transfer learning which utlizes a model
