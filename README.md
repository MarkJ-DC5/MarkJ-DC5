## 📷 Image Classification: Skin Lesion Recognition for Cancer Detection

> **Keywords**: Deep Learning | Computer Vision | Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) | HAM10000 | Pre-Augmentation | Transfer learning | EfficientNetV2 | Soft-Attention | ~~[View Source](https://github.com/MarkJ-DC5)~~

* **[Skin cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6804807/) is the most widespread form of cancer**, with melanoma being its deadliest variant, responsible for 75% of skin cancer-related deaths. Early detection is paramount for effective treatment and positive outcomes.

* In this project, I developed a ***Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model*** capable of classifying ***7 types of skin lesions***, achieving an ***87% accuracy*** and demonstrating strong class discrimination with an ***0.97 AUC***.

* The [HAM10000](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T) dataset by Tschandl, P., Rosendahl, C., & Kittler, H., consisting of 10,015 dermoscopic images, was used for model training and validation. ***Downsampling and Pre-Augmentation*** were performed to address the dataset's significant imbalance.

* ***Transfer learning*** techniques were employed to achieve optimal performance while minimizing training time. [EfficientNetV2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00298) was the chosen pre-trained CNN architecture due to striking the *best balance between model performance and hardware usage*, as determined through testing.

* Additionally, the concept of [Soft-Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.03358.pdf), based on the study of Datta et al., was implemented to ***visualize the area of focus of the model.*** when identifying its class.


## 🗨️ Text Classification: Amazon Product Review Spam Detection 

> **Keywords**: Deep Learning | Natural Language Processing | Text Classification | Recurrent Neural Network | Long Short-Term Memory | Spam Reviews | Batch Processing | ~~[View Source](https://github.com/MarkJ-DC5)~~

* In today's world, online shopping has become incredibly common, reshaping global commerce and expected to generate [$3.2 trillion in revenue by 2024](https://www.statista.com/outlook/emo/ecommerce/worldwide). ***[93% of consumers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.865702/full) states that their purchasing decisions are heavily influenced by reviews***, there is a clear ***need for a system capable of detecting false or spam reviews*** to safeguard genuine feedback and enable informed choices.

* A ***Text Classification model*** was constructed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The model is based on a ***Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model***, specifically utilizing ***Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells***. It attains an ***accuracy of 89%*** in determining whether a review is spam or genuine.

* I utilized the [Amazon Product Review (Spam and Non-Spam) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naveedhn/amazon-product-review-spam-and-non-spam/data) from Naveed Hussain et al., with a total size of 18.4GB comprising of ***26.7 million reviews*** distributed across six product categories. Each category is represented by a JSON file containing respective reviews.

* ***Due to the RAM memory constraints and the dataset's JSON format***, extensive preparation was necessary. I focused on reviews for ***fashion and clothing products***, which [ranked second in sales distribution on Amazon in 2022, representing 24.7% of total sales](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1309691/amazon-sales-share-product-category/), with a JSON file size of 3.21GB. The dataset was then ***converted into a CSV file format containing 5.7 million reviews through batch processing***, preventing memory overload and facilitating further processing and analysis.
