## Image CLassification

### Skin Cancer Classification

> **Keywords**: Deep Learning | Computer Vision | Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) | HAM10000 | Pre-Augmentation | Transfer learning | EfficientNetV2 | Soft-Attention | [View Source](https://github.com/MarkJ-DC5)

* **Skin cancer is the most widespread form of cancer**, with melanoma being its deadliest variant, responsible for 75% of skin cancer-related deaths. Early detection is paramount for effective treatment and positive outcomes.

* In this project, I developed a ***Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model*** capable of classifying ***7 types of skin cancer***, achieving an ***87% accuracy*** and demonstrating strong class discrimination with an ***0.97 AUC***.

* The [HAM10000](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T) dataset by Tschandl, P., Rosendahl, C., & Kittler, H., consisting of 10,015 dermoscopic images, was used for model training and validation. ***Downsampling and Pre-Augmentation*** were performed to address the dataset's significant imbalance.

* ***Transfer learning*** techniques were employed to achieve optimal performance while minimizing training time. [EfficientNetV2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00298) was the chosen pre-trained CNN architecture due to striking the *best balance between model performance and hardware usage*, as determined through testing.

* Additionally, the concept of [Soft-Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.03358.pdf), based on the study of Datta et al., was implemented to ***visualize the area of focus of model*** when identifying its class.
